% Examples: meromorphic f and holomorphic F:X->CP^1
\subsection{Example 1: \(X = \mathbb{CP}^1\) (Riemann sphere)}
We view \(\mathbb{CP}^1\) as the Riemann sphere. On the affine chart \[
U_1 = \{[z_0:z_1]\in\mathbb{CP}^1 \mid z_1\neq 0\},
\] we use the coordinate $z = {z_0}/{z_1}.$ The point at infinity is \(\infty = [1:0]\).

On \(\mathbb{CP}^1\), a meromorphic function is the same as a rational function.
Take for instance
\[
f(z) = \frac{z^2 - 1}{z - 2}.
\]
This is meromorphic on \(\mathbb{CP}^1\), with a simple pole at \(z=2\), and (possibly) a pole at \(\infty\).

Define
\[
F:\mathbb{CP}^1\to\mathbb{CP}^1,\qquad
F(p) =
\begin{cases}
	[f(p):1], & p \text{ not a pole of } f,\\[4pt]
	[1:0], & p \text{ a pole of } f.
\end{cases}
\]

Concretely, for \(p=[z:1]\) with \(z\neq 2\),
\[
F([z:1]) = [f(z):1] = \left[\dfrac{z^2-1}{z-2}:1\right],
\]
and at the pole \(p=[2:1]\),
\[
F([2:1]) = [1:0].
\]
Similarly one checks the value at \(\infty=[1:0]\) using the behavior of \(f(z)\) as
\(|z|\to\infty\).

To see that \(F\) is holomorphic, we use the usual charts on \(\mathbb{CP}^1\):

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{At a non-pole point \(p\).} Suppose \(p\) is not a pole of \(f\).
	Then \(f\) is holomorphic near \(p\) and finite there, so \(F(p)=[f(p):1]\in U_1\).
	Let
	\[
	w = \frac{z_0}{z_1}:U_1\to\mathbb{C}
	\]
	be the affine coordinate on \(U_1\). In this chart,
	\[
	(w\circ F)(q) = \frac{z_0}{z_1}\Big|_{F(q)} = f(q),
	\]
	which is holomorphic in any local coordinate around \(p\). Hence \(F\) is holomorphic at non-poles.
	
	\item \textbf{At a pole \(p\).} Let \(p\) be a pole of order \(m>0\). Choose a local
	coordinate \(z\) on \(\mathbb{CP}^1\) with \(z(p)=0\). Then
	\[
	f(z) = z^{-m} g(z),\qquad g \text{ holomorphic, } g(0)\neq 0.
	\]
	Here \(F(p)=[1:0]\). Use the chart
	\[
	U_0 = \{[z_0:z_1]\in\mathbb{CP}^1 \mid z_0\neq 0\},
	\]
	with coordinate
	\[
	u = \frac{z_1}{z_0} : U_0\to\mathbb{C}.
	\]
	For \(z\neq 0\) near \(p\),
	\[
	F(z) = [f(z):1] = [z^{-m}g(z):1].
	\]
	Multiplying homogeneous coordinates by \(z^m\) (which does not change the point in
	projective space), we get
	\[
	[z^{-m}g(z):1] = [g(z):z^m].
	\]
	Thus, in the chart \(U_0\),
	\[
	(u\circ F)(z) = \frac{z^m}{g(z)}.
	\]
	Since \(g(z)\) is holomorphic with \(g(0)\neq 0\), the function
	\(\dfrac{1}{g(z)}\) is holomorphic near \(0\), and hence
	\[
	\frac{z^m}{g(z)}
	\]
	is holomorphic near \(0\) (and vanishes to order \(m\)). Therefore \(F\) is holomorphic at the pole \(p\).
\end{itemize}

Since we have holomorphicity in local charts at every point of \(\mathbb{CP}^1\),
\(F:\mathbb{CP}^1\to\mathbb{CP}^1\) is a holomorphic map.

\subsection{Example 2: \(X = \mathbb{C}/\Lambda\) (complex torus)}

Let \(\Lambda\subset\mathbb{C}\) be a lattice and consider the complex torus
\[
X = \mathbb{C}/\Lambda.
\]
The quotient map is
\[
\pi:\mathbb{C}\to X,\qquad \pi(z) = [z].
\]

A meromorphic function \(f:X\to\mathbb{C}\) corresponds to a \(\Lambda\)-periodic
meromorphic function \(\tilde f:\mathbb{C}\to\mathbb{C}\) satisfying
\[
\tilde f(z+\lambda) = \tilde f(z),\quad \forall\,\lambda\in\Lambda,
\]
and
\[
f([z]) = \tilde f(z).
\]

A standard example is the Weierstrass \(\wp\)-function \(\wp:\mathbb{C}\to\mathbb{C}\),
which is \(\Lambda\)-periodic and meromorphic with double poles at lattice points.
Thus it descends to a meromorphic
\[
f:X\to\mathbb{C},\qquad f([z]) = \wp(z).
\]

We define
\[
F:X\to\mathbb{CP}^1,\qquad
F(p) =
\begin{cases}
	[f(p):1], & p \text{ not a pole of } f,\\[4pt]
	[1:0], & p \text{ a pole of } f.
\end{cases}
\]

For our example \(f([z])=\wp(z)\):

\begin{itemize}
	\item \(\wp(z)\) has poles precisely at lattice points \(z\in\Lambda\),
	which all represent the same point on the torus, usually denoted \([0]\).
	\item For \([z]\neq[0]\), we set \(F([z]) = [\wp(z):1]\).
	\item At \([0]\), we set \(F([0]) = [1:0]\).
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Local coordinate on the torus near a pole}

To get a local coordinate near \([0]\in X\), choose a small disc
\(D\subset\mathbb{C}\) around \(0\) such that
\(\pi|_D:D\to \pi(D)\) is a biholomorphism.
Then
\[
\varphi:\pi(D)\to\mathbb{C},\qquad \varphi([z]) = z,
\]
is a local coordinate on \(X\) near \([0]\).

The local behavior of \(\wp(z)\) at \(z=0\) is
\[
\wp(z) = \frac{1}{z^2} + \text{holomorphic terms},
\]
so more precisely,
\[
\wp(z) = z^{-2} g(z),\qquad g(z)\ \text{holomorphic, } g(0)\neq 0.
\]
Thus, for the induced \(f\),
\[
f([z]) = \wp(z) = z^{-2} g(z),
\]
so \(f\) has a pole of order \(m=2\) at \([0]\).

\subsubsection{Holomorphicity of \(F\) at the pole \([0]\)}

As before, we use the chart around \([1:0]\in\mathbb{CP}^1\):
\[
U_0 = \{[z_0:z_1]\mid z_0\neq 0\},\qquad
u = \frac{z_1}{z_0}:U_0\to\mathbb{C}.
\]

For \(z\neq 0\) small, we have \(p=[z]\neq[0]\) and
\[
F([z]) = [f([z]):1] = [\wp(z):1] = [z^{-2}g(z):1].
\]
Multiplying the homogeneous coordinates by \(z^2\) gives
\[
[z^{-2}g(z):1] = [g(z):z^2].
\]
So in the chart \(U_0\),
\[
(u\circ F)([z]) = \frac{z^2}{g(z)}.
\]

Since \(g(z)\) is holomorphic with \(g(0)\neq 0\), the function
\(\dfrac{1}{g(z)}\) is holomorphic near \(0\), and hence \(\dfrac{z^2}{g(z)}\)
is holomorphic near \(0\) and vanishes at \(z=0\). In the local coordinate
\(\varphi([z])=z\) on \(X\), the expression
\[
u\circ F\circ \varphi^{-1}(z) = \frac{z^2}{g(z)}
\]
is holomorphic, so \(F\) is holomorphic at the pole \([0]\).

At a non-pole point \([z_0]\in X\), the same argument as in Example~1 applies:
\(f\) is holomorphic and finite, and in the affine chart
\[
U_1 = \{[z_0:z_1]\mid z_1\neq 0\},\qquad w = \frac{z_0}{z_1},
\]
we have
\[
(w\circ F)([z]) = f([z]) = \wp(z),
\]
which is holomorphic in the local coordinate on \(X\).

\subsubsection{Conclusion}

For both examples \(X=\mathbb{CP}^1\) and \(X=\mathbb{C}/\Lambda\), the construction
\[
f:X\to\mathbb{C}\ \text{meromorphic} \quad\longmapsto\quad
F:X\to\mathbb{CP}^1,\quad
F(p)=
\begin{cases}
	[f(p):1], & p \text{ not a pole},\\[4pt]
	[1:0], & p \text{ a pole},
\end{cases}
\]
produces a holomorphic map \(F:X\to\mathbb{CP}^1\). This concretely illustrates
the general principle that a meromorphic function on a Riemann surface is the same
as a holomorphic map to \(\mathbb{CP}^1\).


\newpage
We start with a meromorphic function
\[
f:X\to\mathbb{C}
\]
on a Riemann surface \(X\), and define a map
\[
F:X\to\mathbb{CP}^1
\]
by
\[
F(p)=
\begin{cases}
	[f(p):1], & p \text{ not a pole of } f,\\[4pt]
	[1:0], & p \text{ a pole of } f.
\end{cases}
\]

You’re asking: \textbf{why is this \(F\) holomorphic as a map of Riemann surfaces?}

\bigskip

%-----------------------------------------
\section*{1. Definition to remember}

A map \(F:X\to Y\) between Riemann surfaces is \textbf{holomorphic} if, for every point
\(p\in X\), you can choose local coordinates
\begin{itemize}
	\item \(\varphi\): neighborhood of \(p\to \mathbb{C}\),
	\item \(\psi\): neighborhood of \(F(p)\to \mathbb{C}\),
\end{itemize}
such that the coordinate expression
\[
\psi \circ F \circ \varphi^{-1} : \text{(open in }\mathbb{C})\to \mathbb{C}
\]
is an ordinary holomorphic function.

So we need to check this around:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item a point where \(f\) is holomorphic (no pole),
	\item a point where \(f\) has a pole.
\end{enumerate}

\bigskip

%-----------------------------------------
\section*{2. Case 1: \(p\) is \textbf{not} a pole (easy)}

If \(p\) is not a pole, then \(f\) is holomorphic near \(p\) and finite there.

\begin{itemize}
	\item On \(X\): choose any local coordinate \(z\) with \(z(p)=0\).
	\item On \(\mathbb{CP}^1\): since \(F(p)=[f(p):1]\) has second coordinate \(\neq 0\),
	it lies in the chart
	\[
	U_1 = \{[z_0:z_1]\mid z_1\neq 0\}
	\]
	with coordinate
	\[
	w = \frac{z_0}{z_1} : U_1\to\mathbb{C}.
	\]
\end{itemize}

Then on some neighborhood of \(p\),
\[
(w\circ F)(q) = \frac{z_0}{z_1}\Big|_{F(q)}
= \frac{f(q)}{1}
= f(q),
\]
which is holomorphic in \(z\).

So \(\psi\circ F\circ\varphi^{-1} = f\) is holomorphic \(\Rightarrow F\) is holomorphic at non-pole points.

\bigskip

%-----------------------------------------
\section*{3. Case 2: \(p\) is a \textbf{pole} of order \(m>0\)}

This is the interesting part.

Let \(p\) be a pole of \(f\) of order \(m\). Choose a local coordinate \(z\) on \(X\)
with \(z(p)=0\). By the definition of meromorphic:
\[
f(z) = z^{-m} g(z),
\]
where \(g\) is holomorphic and \(g(0)\neq 0\).

By definition,
\[
F(p) = [1:0] \in \mathbb{CP}^1.
\]

Now we must look at a chart of \(\mathbb{CP}^1\) that contains \([1:0]\). That is:
\[
U_0 = \{[z_0:z_1]\mid z_0\neq 0\},
\]
with coordinate
\[
u = \frac{z_1}{z_0} : U_0\to\mathbb{C},
\]
and in this chart \([1:0]\) corresponds to \(u=0\).

For \(z \neq 0\) near \(p\),
\[
F(z) = [f(z):1] = [z^{-m}g(z):1].
\]

Multiply homogeneous coordinates by \(z^m\) (allowed in projective space):
\[
[z^{-m}g(z):1] = [g(z):z^m].
\]

So in the chart \(U_0\) we have:
\[
u(F(z)) = \frac{z^m}{g(z)}.
\]

Now, check holomorphicity:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \(g(z)\) is holomorphic with \(g(0)\neq 0\) \(\Rightarrow 1/g(z)\) is holomorphic near \(0\).
	\item \(z^m\) is holomorphic.
	\item The product \(z^m \cdot \dfrac{1}{g(z)}\) is holomorphic near \(0\).
\end{itemize}

So
\[
u\circ F(z) = \frac{z^m}{g(z)}
\]
is an ordinary holomorphic function of \(z\) on a neighborhood of \(0\), and it extends to \(z=0\) with value \(0\).

Thus, in local coordinates,
\[
\psi\circ F\circ\varphi^{-1} = u\circ F
\]
is holomorphic at \(z=0\). Therefore, \textbf{\(F\) is holomorphic at the pole \(p\)}.

\bigskip

%-----------------------------------------
\section*{4. Conclusion}

We have checked:
\begin{itemize}
	\item At non-poles: in the chart \(U_1\), \(w\circ F = f\) is holomorphic.
	\item At poles: in the chart \(U_0\), \(u\circ F = z^m/g(z)\) is holomorphic.
\end{itemize}

So at \textbf{every} point \(p\in X\), we can choose charts making the coordinate expression
of \(F\) holomorphic. That’s exactly the definition:
\[
\boxed{F:X\to\mathbb{CP}^1\ \text{is holomorphic.}}
\]

This is why we can safely say:
%\[
%\text{“A meromorphic function on }X\text{ is the same as a holomorphic map }X\to\mathbb{CP}^1.”}
%\]



\newpage
\section{Note 3: The Isomorphism $\mathcal{M}(\CP^1)\simeq\C(x)$}
We explain that the field of meromorphic functions on
\(\CP^1\) is isomorphic to the field \(\C(x)\) of rational functions in
one variable.
\[
\mathcal M(X)
=
\left\{
\,\overline{i\circ f}\in(\mathbb{CP}^1)^X
\;\middle|\;
f \text{ meromorphic on }X
\right\},
\] \[
\mathcal M(X)
=
\{\,F:X\to\mathbb{CP}^1 \mid F \text{ holomorphic}\,\}.
\]

\subsection{Charts on $\CP^1$ and Field of Meromorphic Functions}
View $\CP^1$ as the Riemann sphere. Consider the standard affine chart \[
U_1 = \{[z_0:z_1]\in\mathbb{CP}^1 \mid z_1\neq 0\}
\] with coordinate map \[
\fullfunction{\phi_1}{U_1}{\C}{[z_0:z_1]}{\displaystyle\frac{z_0}{z_1}}.
\]
\begin{figure}[h!]\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=1.5]{tikzs/CP1_chart}
\end{figure}

\medskip\noindent
We write
\[
x := \phi_1,
\]
and think of \(x\) as the \emph{coordinate function} on \(U_1\).
This function extends meromorphically to all of \(\CP^1\), with a simple
pole at \(\infty = [1:0]\).

We define the field of meromorphic functions on \(\CP^1\) as
\[
\M(\CP^1)
=
\{ F:\CP^1\to\CP^1 \mid F \text{ holomorphic}\},
\]
viewing a meromorphic function as a holomorphic map into \(\CP^1\)
(via the usual convention ``finite value \(\mapsto [f(p):1]\), pole
\(\mapsto [1:0]\)'').

On the other hand, the field \(\C(x)\) is
\[
\C(x)
=
\left\{
\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}
\;\middle|\;
p,q \in \C[x],\ q\not\equiv 0
\right\}\Big/\sim,
\]
where \(\frac{p}{q}\sim\frac{p'}{q'}\) if \(p(x)q'(x)=p'(x)q(x)\).


\newpage

\newpage
\medskip\noindent
Here \(\phi_1\) is a biholomorphism between \(U_1\) and \(\mathbb{C}\), its inverse is \[
\fullfunction{\phi_1^{-1}}{\C}{U_1}{z}{[z:1]}.
\]
We’ll write
\[
x := \phi_1
\]
and think of \(x\) as the \emph{coordinate function} on \(U_1\). It extends meromorphically
to all of \(\mathbb{CP}^1\) with a simple pole at \([1:0]\) (the point at infinity).

\bigskip

%-----------------------------------------
\section*{1. Describe both sides with \(\phi_1\)}

\subsection*{Side 1: \(\mathcal{M}(\mathbb{CP}^1)\)}

We use the “holomorphic map to \(\mathbb{CP}^1\)” definition:
\[
\mathcal{M}(\mathbb{CP}^1)
=
\left\{
F:\mathbb{CP}^1\to\mathbb{CP}^1 \ \middle|\ F\ \text{holomorphic}
\right\}.
\]

We want to use \(\phi_1\), so whenever the image of \(F\) lies in \(U_1\), we can look at
\[
\phi_1\circ F : \ (\text{some open set}) \to\mathbb{C}.
\]
That’s just the “affine coordinate” of the value of \(F\).

\subsection*{Side 2: \(\mathbb{C}(x)\)}

\[
\mathbb{C}(x)
=
\left\{
\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}
\ \middle|\
p(x),q(x)\in\mathbb{C}[x],\ q(x)\not\equiv 0
\right\}
\Big/\sim,
\]
where \(\frac{p}{q}\sim\frac{p'}{q'}\) iff \(p(x)q'(x)=p'(x)q(x)\).

Here the symbol \(x\) is exactly your coordinate function
\[
x = \phi_1 : U_1\to\mathbb{C}.
\]

\bigskip

%-----------------------------------------
\section*{2. Map \(\mathbb{C}(x) \to \mathcal{M}(\mathbb{CP}^1)\) using \(\phi_1\)}

Take a rational function
\[
R(x) = \frac{p(x)}{q(x)} \in \mathbb{C}(x).
\]

\noindent\textbf{On the affine chart \(U_1\):}

Given a point \([z_0:z_1]\in U_1\), write
\[
x([z_0:z_1]) = \phi_1([z_0:z_1]) = z_0/z_1 =: z.
\]

We \emph{define} a map \(F_R:\mathbb{CP}^1\to\mathbb{CP}^1\) by saying on \(U_1\),
\[
\phi_1\big(F_R([z_0:z_1])\big) = R\big(\phi_1([z_0:z_1])\big) = R(z).
\]

In other words,
\[
F_R|_{U_1} = \phi_1^{-1}\circ R\circ \phi_1.
\]

Concretely:
\[
F_R([z_0:z_1]) = [R(z_0/z_1):1]
\quad\text{(for }z_1\neq 0,\ R(z)\neq\infty\text{)}.
\]

At points where \(R(z)=\infty\) (i.e.\ \(q(z)=0\)), we set
\[
F_R([z_0:z_1]) = [1:0].
\]

This defines \(F_R\) on \(U_1\cup\{\infty\}\), but one must check it is \emph{holomorphic at \(\infty\)}.
Using homogeneous polynomials is a cleaner way:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Let \(\deg p\le m,\ \deg q\le m\). Define
	\[
	P(z_0,z_1) = z_1^m p(z_0/z_1),\quad
	Q(z_0,z_1) = z_1^m q(z_0/z_1),
	\]
	homogeneous of degree \(m\).
	\item Then set
	\[
	F_R([z_0:z_1]) =
	\begin{cases}
		[P(z_0,z_1):Q(z_0,z_1)], & Q(z_0,z_1)\neq 0,\\[4pt]
		[1:0], & Q(z_0,z_1)=0.
	\end{cases}
	\]
\end{itemize}

This is well-defined and holomorphic on all of \(\mathbb{CP}^1\). In the chart \(U_1\), this is
exactly \(\phi_1^{-1}\circ R\circ\phi_1\).

So we get a map
\[
\Phi:\mathbb{C}(x) \to \mathcal{M}(\mathbb{CP}^1),\quad
R \mapsto F_R.
\]

\bigskip

%-----------------------------------------
\section*{3. Use \(\phi_1\) to go backwards: from \(F\) to \(R(x)\)}

Now take any
\[
F \in \mathcal{M}(\mathbb{CP}^1),
\quad F:\mathbb{CP}^1\to\mathbb{CP}^1\ \text{holomorphic}.
\]

We want to show: \emph{there exists a unique rational function \(R(x)\in\mathbb{C}(x)\) such that}
\[
F = F_R.
\]

Using \(\phi_1\):

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Consider the open set where the image of \(F\) stays inside \(U_1\):
	\[
	V := F^{-1}(U_1) \subset \mathbb{CP}^1.
	\]
	
	\item On \(V\), define
	\[
	f := \phi_1\circ F : V\to\mathbb{C}.
	\]
	
	In local coordinates, \(f\) is holomorphic. So \(f\) is a holomorphic function on the
	Riemann surface \(V\).
	
	\item The complement \(\mathbb{CP}^1\setminus V = F^{-1}(\infty)\) is a \emph{finite set}
	(preimages of the point \([1:0]\) under a holomorphic map from a compact Riemann surface).
	At those points, we’ll see \(f\) has poles. So in the chart \(\phi_1\), \(f\) is a
	\emph{meromorphic function on \(\mathbb{C}\)} with finitely many poles.
\end{enumerate}

Now, via \(\phi_1\), we can identify \(\mathbb{CP}^1\setminus\{\infty\}\) with \(\mathbb{C}\). Under this,
\(F\) becomes a meromorphic function
\[
\tilde f : \mathbb{C}\to\mathbb{C}\cup\{\infty\},
\]
which has only finitely many poles (coming from \(F^{-1}(\infty)\)) and maybe a pole at \(\infty\).

From standard complex analysis:

\begin{quote}
	A meromorphic function on \(\mathbb{CP}^1\) (i.e.\ on \(\mathbb{C}\cup\{\infty\}\)) is \emph{rational}.
\end{quote}

Concretely, we do the principal-part argument \emph{in the coordinate \(\phi_1\)}:

\begin{itemize}
	\item In the \(x\)-coordinate (i.e.\ using \(\phi_1\) as your chart), \(f(x)\) has Laurent expansions
	at each finite pole \(x=a_j\).
	\item You build a rational function \(R(x)\) whose principal parts match those of \(f\) at all
	finite poles and at \(\infty\).
	\item Then \(f(x)-R(x)\) is entire and holomorphic at \(\infty\), so it’s constant. So
	\(f(x)=R(x)+C\), still rational.
\end{itemize}

Thus there exists some \(R(x)\in\mathbb{C}(x)\) such that
\[
f(x) = R(x) \quad\text{as meromorphic functions on }\mathbb{C}\cup\{\infty\}.
\]

But \(f = \phi_1\circ F\) and \(R\circ \phi_1\) have the same values on \(U_1\), so
\[
\phi_1\circ F = R\circ\phi_1 \quad\text{on }U_1,
\]
hence
\[
F|_{U_1} = \phi_1^{-1}\circ R\circ\phi_1 = F_R|_{U_1}.
\]

Both \(F\) and \(F_R\) are holomorphic maps \(\mathbb{CP}^1\to\mathbb{CP}^1\) that agree on the
nonempty open set \(U_1\), so by the identity theorem they agree everywhere:
\[
F = F_R.
\]

So every \(F\in\mathcal{M}(\mathbb{CP}^1)\) comes from a unique \(R\in\mathbb{C}(x)\). That’s surjectivity
and injectivity of \(\Phi\).

\section*{4. Summary in your language}

Using your chart
\[
\phi_1:U_1\to\mathbb{C},\quad [z_0:z_1]\mapsto z_0/z_1,
\]
we have:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Define \(x:=\phi_1\). This is a meromorphic function on \(\mathbb{CP}^1\) with one pole at \([1:0]\).
	\item Given \(R(x)\in\mathbb{C}(x)\), we define a holomorphic map \(F_R:\mathbb{CP}^1\to\mathbb{CP}^1\) by
	\[
	F_R = \phi_1^{-1}\circ R\circ\phi_1 \quad\text{on }U_1,
	\]
	extended holomorphically to \(\infty\).
	\item Given a holomorphic \(F:\mathbb{CP}^1\to\mathbb{CP}^1\), its coordinate expression
	\[
	f = \phi_1\circ F\circ \phi_1^{-1} : \mathbb{C}\cup\{\infty\}\to\mathbb{C}\cup\{\infty\}
	\]
	is a meromorphic function on the sphere, hence a rational function \(R(x)\). Then \(F=F_R\).
\end{itemize}

So precisely:
\[
\boxed{
	\mathcal{M}(\mathbb{CP}^1)
	=
	\{F:\mathbb{CP}^1\to\mathbb{CP}^1\ \text{holomorphic}\}
	\ \cong\
	\{R(x)\in\mathbb{C}(x)\}
}
\]
and the chart \(\phi_1\) is the bridge that makes this identification explicit.

%	From the standpoint of solving equations, the algebraic structures we have discussed are interconnected in the following ways:
%	
%	\subsection*{Group}
%	A \textbf{group} provides a foundation for solving equations involving a single operation. The group structure ensures that every element has an inverse, allowing us to "undo" operations and solve equations. For instance, in the group of integers \( (\mathbb{Z}, +) \), the equation \( x + a = b \) can be solved as \( x = b - a \).
%	
%	\subsection*{Ring}
%	A \textbf{ring} extends the concept of a group by introducing a second operation, typically multiplication, in addition to addition. Rings allow us to solve more complex equations that involve both addition and multiplication. For example, solving polynomial equations \( f(x) = 0 \) where \( f(x) \) is a polynomial with coefficients in a ring \( R \).
%	
%	\subsection*{Field}
%	A \textbf{field} is a ring with additional properties that make division possible (except by zero). This structure is crucial for solving linear equations and systems of linear equations. In a field \( F \), any linear equation \( ax = b \) (where \( a \neq 0 \)) can be solved as \( x = a^{-1}b \), where \( a^{-1} \) is the multiplicative inverse of \( a \).
%	
%	\subsection*{Vector Space}
%	A \textbf{vector space} over a field \( F \) is a set of vectors that can be added together and scaled by elements of \( F \). Vector spaces provide a framework for solving linear systems of equations. Solutions to systems of linear equations can be understood as finding vectors \( \mathbf{x} \in V \) such that \( A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b} \), where \( A \) is a matrix and \( \mathbf{b} \) is a vector in \( V \).
%	
%	\subsection*{Module}
%	A \textbf{module} is a generalization of vector spaces where the scalars come from a ring instead of a field. Modules allow us to solve equations in contexts where the coefficients are not from a field, such as systems of linear equations with integer coefficients. For example, solving \( A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b} \) where \( A \) is a matrix with entries from a ring \( R \) and \( \mathbf{x}, \mathbf{b} \in M \).
%	
%	\subsection*{Algebra}
%	An \textbf{algebra} over a field \( F \) combines the structures of a vector space and a ring. Algebras provide a framework for solving polynomial equations and other equations involving both addition and multiplication of vectors. In an algebra \( A \), we can solve equations like \( x^2 + ax + b = 0 \) using techniques from both linear algebra and ring theory.
%	
%	\subsection*{Summary}
%	The conceptual connection between these structures is rooted in the increasing complexity and capability they offer for solving equations:
%	\begin{itemize}
%		\item \textbf{Groups} provide a way to solve equations with a single operation.
%		\item \textbf{Rings} introduce a second operation, allowing for more complex equations.
%		\item \textbf{Fields} enable division, which is essential for solving linear equations.
%		\item \textbf{Vector spaces} over fields extend these concepts to systems of linear equations.
%		\item \textbf{Modules} generalize vector spaces to allow coefficients from rings.
%		\item \textbf{Algebras} integrate vector space and ring structures, enabling the solution of polynomial and other complex equations.
